    <section class="Intro">
        <!-- Inside I am using a span class called "special-text" to highlight the Words "The Talkboy"-->
        <p>Remember how was life in the 90's? Everything seemed so easy and relaxed; we were happy, and we knew it. Being fashionable was wearing jeans and sneakers. After school, we used to hang out with our friends. Movie stars were our heroes. Our favourite music was always played in the background. Music was played by cassettes and CDs. Computers were heavy blocks. Internet was still a new thing that very few people were interested in. Our lives were like the movies...  </p>
        <p>Talking about movies, do you remember Home Alone 2? How can we forget when Kevin, a clever child, outsmarted a group of adults, including his own family. But he didn't make it alone. Besides his brains, he had the help of technology. What did he use? He used <span class="special-text">a Talkboy!!!</span></p>
        <p>Brought to you from the movies, <span class="special-text">the Talkboy</span> is an excellent device that opens the door that connects fantasy with reality. With a Talkboy, you can record, distort and play your voice or any voice you want, any time you want. You can play a prank to your peers, and feel again like a child for a few seconds. Because to remember is to live again... </p>
