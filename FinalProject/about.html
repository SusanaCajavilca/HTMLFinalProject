        <h2 id="toblue">Our History</h2>
        <p>It all started when Gerald Rissman, Randy Rissman and Arnold Rissman founded the company in June 1978. Our headquarters were in Vernon Hills, Illinois. First, our products were low-tech items like phonographs. Then, we began developing handheld electronic games and educational toys. Tiger achieved success with many simple handheld electronics games and titles based on licenses. One of our early 1990s hit was the variable-speed portable cassette player and recorder, the Talkboy (first seen in the 1992 movie Home Alone 2: Lost in New York), but it was not the only successful product   </p>
        <p>Our success is indebted to the following three factors:</p>
        <p> <span class="special-text2">Our effective licensing</span>: Tiger people read all the magazines and talked to all the studios to keep on the cutting edge of what's hot with kids. With that, Tiger was able to pursue desirable licenses quickly and aggressively. This allowed them to release licensed games while the properties they were licensed from were still at the peak of their popularity.</p>
        <p><span class="special-text2">Our low price per game</span>: Tiger handheld games sold for roughly $20 each. By comparison, most handheld games of the time cost over $30, and required a separately sold system (an additional $50 or more) to play it on. So Tigers' products were the most affordable option of the market</p>
        <p><span class="special-text2">Our simplistic style</span>: Tiger developed addictive gameplays. Kids aged five to twelve years old, found Tigers' toys simple and their mechanics very easy to learn. This was a huge advantage because Tigers' toys  were more appealing to their target than other options.</p>
        <p>Tiger Electronics has been part of the Hasbro toy company since 1998. Together with Hasbro, we have continued to work towards the same original goal: to design, produce and sell toys that entertains and connect generations of fans through the wonder of storytelling and exhilaration of play. We are proud to be part of a successful multinational conglomerate holding company that is leader in the fields of toys and entertainment. We may have changed our name, but our essence still remains with our compromise to keep our original values and apply the newest market techniques at the same time.</p>
